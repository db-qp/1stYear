# QuizStats

This program will take an input formatted like quiz.txt with the number of rows as the first number and number of columns as the second followed by all
of the quiz grades. It will compute the highest and lowest scores on each quiz as well as the average of each quiz. In addition, it calculates each student's
average quiz grade with the lowest quiz dropped. It prints the file "quiz.txt" along with average of all scores on all quizzes, highest, lowest, and average
grade on each quiz, and each student's average grade with the lowest quiz dropped.
